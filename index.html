<h4 class="uk-heading-line"><span>About me</span></h4>
<span class="uk-text">I'm a Ph.D. student working in the <a class="uk-link-muted" href="https://www.cgmi.uni-konstanz.de/" target="_blank">Visual Computing</a> group of Prof. Deussen at the University of Konstanz. My area of research is information visualization, with a focus on visualization of uncertainty. I'm curious to work on challenging problems and understand their theoretical and mathematical foundations.</span>

<p class="uk-text">When I'm not spending time with my family or working, you often find me with friends in the mountains going backcountry skiing or climbing. I also enjoy traveling and exploring new places. Below are some photos that I took along the way.</p>
